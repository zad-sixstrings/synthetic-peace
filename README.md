## WIP

This is my current Arch desktop setup and it is still a work in progress. Some configurations might differ slightly from the screenshots.

Some configs and dotfiles are still very similar to existing themes (the waybar especially). I use them as a starting point. The original authors of configs I use without edits, or with minimal edits, will be credited.
